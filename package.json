  "readme": "jsonresume-theme-compact\n========================\n\nA compact theme for a json-resume (http://jsonresume.org/)\n\n[Demo](http://themes.jsonresume.org/compact)\n\n## Usage \n\nTo get started with this JSONResume theme, you'll need to have the \nJSONResume CLI installed. If you haven't already install it with \n```npm install -g resume-cli```. If this doesn't work, try \n```sudo npm install -g resume-cli```. After that, you can get your resume.json \nready by typing ```resume init```. After hitting enter, your resume will be \ninitialized and you can edit it and fill in the neccessary fields. Check out \n[the official resume-schema repository](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema) \nfor more information on filling these fields.\n\nWhen you are finished with your resume, you may test it by yet again opening the \ncommand line and typing ```resume serve --theme compact``` to see how it looks \nwith this theme. You can replace the word compact with other theme names too.\n\nIf you want a local copy of your resume, type in \n```resume export resumeName --theme compact```, and replace resumeName with the \ndesired filename. You can export it in pdf and txt using the ```--format``` flag, \nlike so:\n```resume export resume --format pdf --theme compact```\nHowever, if you wish to export it to the JSONResume Registry, use the command \n```resume publish``` instead.\n\nMore details about the CLI and it's commands are available [here](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli).\n\n## Tips\n * In the interest of compactness, this theme currently ignores the following resume data:\n   - publications\n    - languages\n   - references\n * Other fields are ignored too (skill level, location, full dates, etc). \n * Your networks are shown in the top section of the resume. The resume template\n    tries to use a font-awesome icon for each network named ```fa-{{network}}```. If \n    you enter a network with no corresponding font-awesome icon, it will not \n    be displayed properly. You can see the networks that are supported by \n    browsing the [font-awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/).\n * PDF generation via ```resume export``` doesn't quite work with this theme. For\n creating a PDF version using this theme, try manually saving the html version \n via Chrome",
